### List of prompts used
1. Property amenities are not a top priority, though they can be helpful. I want the amenities filter to appear as a checklist dropdown that integrates seamlessly with the UI.

2. The ‘Number of Filters’ button can be moved to the top-right corner and placed directly next to the ‘Search & Filters’ section.

3. The amenities section is not properly aligned and needs to be adjusted for correct alignment within the UI.

4. I want the active status to be a bit more visually creative—for example, greying out the elements in inactive cards.

5. Please update the UI to replace the term ‘property’ wherever it appears across the interface, ensuring consistency throughout all sections.

6. The term ‘Property’ is not user-friendly. Please replace it across the entire UI with a term that is easily understandable for non-technical users.

7. Increase the font weight or darkness for the ‘Search & Filters’ text to make it more prominent and readable.

8. The current focus ring doesn’t look good. Either enhance its design to make it more visually appealing or replace it with a different, more attractive way to indicate focus.

9. Review the frontend repository again and suggest improvements to fully leverage the features of Next.js.
